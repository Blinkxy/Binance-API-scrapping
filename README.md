# Description
This is a sample python code that allows you to collect data about Ethereum and Bitcoin,
from Binance.com using their API.
After running the code it will generate an Excel file with the different data about those coins such as open/close prices as well as
volatility ratio of those coins for each day.
The data collected goes as far as 267 ago, which seems to be the limit set by the API (even tho i set the code to collect the last 365 days)

## Excel sample
You will find along with the code a sample of the spreadsheet.
